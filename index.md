# Welcome​

*This unofficial profile was created as a demo of a job market website in Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages.*

My name is Zachary Schmidt, and I am a junior Mechatronics student at Northern Illinois University. I am involved in the [NIU Supermileage club](https://www.niusupermileage.com/), quadruped robot research with Dr. Peter Lin, and the Immanuel Luthern Church of DeKalb, IL where I am a peer minister of the [college ministry group 'Refuge'](https://immanueldekalb.com/campus-ministry/).

### Background

I was born in Knakakee, IL and grew up on a small family farm where I learned the importance of hard work, integrity, and responsibility from a young age. I was the Salutatorian for my graduating class at Herscher Highschool where I was involved in many sports and extracirrculars.
