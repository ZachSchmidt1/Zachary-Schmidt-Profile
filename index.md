*This unofficial profile was created as a demo of a job market website in Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages.*

My name is Zachary Schmidt, and I am a junior Mechatronics student at Northern Illinois University.

### Background

I was born in Knakakee, IL and grew up on a small family farm where I learned the importance of hard work and integrity from a young age.
