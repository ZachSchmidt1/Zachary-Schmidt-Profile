### BP-1
* Open source is source code that is free and open for the public to copy, distribute, and alter with permissions. 
* Google, IBM, Microsoft, Meta (Facebook), and [Unitree Robotics](https://github.com/unitreerobotics) all use open source. These well-known companies use open source, therefore showing how relevant and important open source is. 
* One surprising aspect of open source is big companies use open source software and allow public access to this code. 
#### Firsts  
* First time using markdown and it seems straight forward and intuitive. 
* Meet new peers

### BP-2 
#### Learnings 
* I have learned some of the basic features and practices of Git and GitHub for the first time. 
* Some of the features I learned are how to make a new repository, a new branch, and add files. 
* I also learned the proffesionally recognized way of adding to an existing repository. 
  *  First, make a new branch, then add a file or make a change, commit the changes, and merge with the main branch. 
* The similarities of Git and windows shell were surprising, and the power and simplicity of markdown was as well. 
#### Applications 
* This knowledge can help me to use the correct and professional procedure when contributing to open source repositories. 
* I also learned the importance of proffesional documentation and how to better describe the changes or actions.

### BP-03
#### Learnings 
* I choose a [4-wheeled line-folling repository](https://github.com/Kronbii/Self-Driving-Car?tab=readme-ov-file) to explore becuase it is Arduino-based program and I am familiar with arduino. Also, I did a similar project in the MCTR 210 class final project, so it was interesting to see the differences. The repository has a good structure that is also explained in the README file. There is not much of a community with zero issues posted and only a few pull requests by the owner of the repository. There is a contribution process outlined on the README file as well. Overall, the repository seems to not have much traffic or recency besides the one commit a few days ago. Otherwise the only activity was a pull request from two years ago.
* I learned about the importance of commit messages and the range of repositories available. 
#### New Findings 
* I learned about all of the options open source has. In class I was exposed to different people's interests and the open source options for those interests and my own.
* I also learned there are many repositories that give many different ways to use some simple and complex ideas.

### BP-04.5 
#### Learnings 
* I learned about the projects tab in Github and how it can be used to monitor progress of multiple projects and teams. 
* I also learned about how to better search in the issues and pull requests tabs to more easily find desired posts using the search bar for that tab. This way of filtering the
issues and pull requests gives more filtering options than just using the drop down menus at the top of the tabs and better results while searching. 
* I learned how to create a pull request, review a pull request, and make suggestions for a pull request. 

#### New Findings 
* I just learned about using the projects tab and how to more effectively search for issues and pull requests in Github. 
* I also was able to find multiple ROS2 Humble open source repositories, some of which could be directly used with the Unitree GO2 EDU quadruped my research group recently
recieved. We are actively trying to better understand the connectivity and control of the robot, and these open source repositories can give much needed information on how to
best utilize, connect to, and control our four-legged robots.

### BP-04
#### Learnings 
* I learned about the existance of [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js?tab=readme-ov-file) and what it is. Reveal.js is structured with one owner and a bunch of other contributers. Reveal.js is an open source project that uses HTML framework for presentaions. This project gives a lot of features and flexibility for customizing slide themes, text, and animations to personalize presentations. In, addition, Markdown can also be used for text configuration and structuring.
* I do not think I would contribute to Reveal.js because it is not overly interesting to me right now. Personally, I would use google sides, but I am not familiar with Reveal.js, its range of features, or how to use them effectively.
* I also learned about GitHub pages and how to make one for a repository. 

##### Revel.js structure and maintainance 
* The repository seems well structured with an example folder, easy-to-follow README file, license, and well-established contribution guide. 
* The documentation was done well, and I found the support idea interesting to subscribe to a similar, paid project. Also, it's cool to see over 300 contributors, over 780,000 users, over 15,000 forks, and all of the other ways people have added, used, and improved this open source project. 

#### New Findings 
* I just learned about Reveal.js and its range of uses. 
* I also learned about GitHub pages and how to make one.

#### Learnings 
* I learned about how Tetris came to be outside of Russia and the licensing issues that came with it. 
* I also learned about some of the licensing rights of NIU. 

#### Licensing 
* I learned about some of the slight differences between different open-source licenses. For example, the MIT license is slightly different from BSD 3.0 license in the sense that the BSD license has a “no endorsement” clause. 
* Tetris helped to shape my understanding of software ownership and distribution from all of the misunderstandings and bad communication leading to the improper use and selling of goods that are not legally owned. 
* Who owns the rights to intellectual property surprised me about NIU’s approach to IP, patents, and tech transfer. Only if the idea or product was made in an NIU lab or NIU employee could NIU have the rights. 
* I think that licensing can complicate open innovation that utilizes existing licensed ideas and products, but it also rewards those who can innovate new, self-sufficient ideas and products who can benefit from the protection and earnings of licensing. 
* [ros2_learners]( https://github.com/Robotisim/ros2_learners?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) has an MIT license that the software is free of charge to use there just needs to be copyright notice and permission notice in all copies. The software is “AS IS” and has no warranty on the use or application of the software.

#### New Findings 
* I did not know about the history of Tetris or its implications on the licensing world. I enjoy playing Tetris, but now I will also think about the history and impact it had on the current licensing process. 
* I am looking forward to the Global Hack Week event where I can learn some new skills and applications.

#### Learnings 
* On the third day, I attended the ROS2 workshop where I was able to learn about the basics of ROS2. For example, I learned some new terms, tips, and tricks about the
structuring, installing, and utilizing of ROS2 Humble. Because I have dealt a little bit with ROS2 Humble for a senior design robot for research and had learned some things,
I was also able to reinforce some of that previous knowledge and gain some new insights and guidance. 
* On the fifth day, I attended the IOT and MQTT workshop where I was able to learn about MQTT and its interaction with IOT. I knew of Internet Of Things before but not much
more than that, whereas after the workshop I know more about IOT and how I can use it for tasks. I was able to learn the architecture of MQTT and how to use it in conjunction
with IOT to create a network of publishers, subscribers, and a mix of both. 
* On the last day, I attended the YOLO and DeepSort workshop where I was able to learn about learning machines, data sets, and parameters for YOLO and DeepSort. I also learned
how to implement YOLO as an ‘input’ to DeepSort in order to track the objects that YOLO finds each with their own object IDs and how to fine tune YOLO to improve object
recognition without changing the whole algorithm. 
* Overall, I was able to learn a lot more about two areas of valuable information that are highly related to my major. ROS2 is a commonly used architecture for robotic systems
these days, the four-legged Unitree robot and others use MQTT and IOT to become more advanced, and vision-based robots are gaining momentum and therefore object tracking is
becoming increasingly important. I was also able to meet new people and have more resources at my disposal such as
[Charbel Breydy Torres](https://github.com/Buly1601/GHW_Stream_Repo/tree/main/OpenSource_2025) who taught at the IOT and MQTT workshop and the YOLO and DeepSort workshop. 
 

#### New Findings 
* I was hoping to learn more about creating ROS2 Humble code to run on a robot or simulate one through a demo, but unfortunately there was not a demo for this ROS2 workshop. 
* I had heard about YOLO and IOT before but not MQTT or DeepSort before Global Hack Week. I was able to pick up on the key ideas and how to implement them with demos and other
resources thanks to the MLH and its teachers.

### BP-07 
#### Learnings 
* In open source, a contribution is an addition of materials or ideas to a repository or project.  
* Code and non-code contributions are both extremely helpful for a repository. The code contributions are the main contributions for a working project to complete a goal, but the non-code contributions are what make the repository easy to follow, repeatable, and understandable. Without non-code contributions, visitors would have to know the whole repository, how it works, and where everything is at in order to understand the project, let alone contribute to the repository. One way of describing the connection between code and non-code contributions would be the code contributions are the main character in a movie, and the non-code contributions are all of the supporting roles. 
* Diagrams greatly help to show the workflow. For example, in ROS2 there is the rqt_graph function that is a graphical display that shows the nodes or main code pieces and where variables come from and where they go afterward. In other words, it shows the flow of information which can help with troubleshooting, explanations, and understanding the different pieces of the code individually and as a whole. ![rqt_graph](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/594a8c2d-5bac-414c-a4e6-b444acad6841)

* Communication helps to keep everyone on the same page, and collaboration helps to come up with better and better ideas. Together, they can enable productive, efficient, and thoughtful groups. This is great with non-code contributions because it allows people to share their struggles and where clarity can be added through diagrams, word documents, or other non-code resources and collaboration allows for differing views and compounding of ideas for better understanding. 
* I was able to find one non-code contribution opportunity at [Weblate](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate) where implementing documentation in version control is an existing [issue]( https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues/16257). 
* Bonus: One non-code contribution in a project I could be interested in contributing to is [Weblate](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate). 
#### New Findings 
* I just learned about Mermaid, and my first thought was about its similarities to rqt_graph in ROS2. I remember first seeing a rqt_graph for a project, and it greatly helped me to understand the basics of both ROS2 and the project. I could see how the flow of information went from one node to another in order to move a knee servo of the quadruped which had a feedback loop to verify the servo moved to the correct angle to move the robot.
